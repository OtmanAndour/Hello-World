# Hello-World
Nice to meet y'all :D
Im' just learning some of the features of GitHub, like commits and other stuff :D
Oh and please excuse my flawed english haha ^^

I've imported this repository into my computuer to change it from Git.
I'm gonna then send it back to GitHub (So exciting :D ! )


Now let's rewind: I'm gonna edit this from GitHub and pull the changes to my computer to work with Git.
